## OpenCv Raspberry Build
This is a build script to make compiling and installing OpenCV easier on a RaspberryPi running Raspian Jessie.

This is in active development and not quite ready for general use.

If you'd like to test the script out, please have your data backed up first.  Also note that this will run apt-get and update/install software as well.

## OpenCv Raspberry Build
This is a build script to make compiling and installing OpenCV easier on a RaspberryPi running Raspian Jessie.

This is in active development and not ready for general use.

If you'd like to test the script out, please have your data backed up first.  Until I'm happy with the stability, the code will remain on the testing branch.
